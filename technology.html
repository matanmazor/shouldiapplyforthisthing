  <h3>Next generation NLP <h3>

    <p>The algorithm behind this webpage follows a simple rule: it always advises you to apply for this thing.</p>

  <p>This is not meant to be a practical joke. Many potentially great candidates hold themselves from applying because they underestimate their own competence. Sadly, this means that science and society miss out on a treasure of hidden talent. How about you do your part and apply for <i>this thing</i>, and let them decide if you should get <i>this thing</i> or not?</p>

  <p>Good luck <3</p>
